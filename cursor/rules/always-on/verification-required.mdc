# Verification Requirements

## Core Rule: NEVER Claim Complete Without Verification

**Before marking ANY task as complete, perform 1-3 verification steps:**

### Verification Hierarchy (closest to user experience wins)

1. **End-User Testing** (BEST)
   - Run the application locally: `yarn rw dev`
   - Access in terminal: `curl http://localhost:8912` or browser test
   - Verify actual functionality works as user would experience it
   - Check console output, network requests, actual rendering

2. **Integration Testing** (GOOD)
   - Run `yarn rw build` - verify builds successfully
   - Test API endpoints via GraphQL playground
   - Check component integration in running app
   - Verify cross-component communication

3. **Component Testing** (ACCEPTABLE)
   - Run test suite: `yarn rw test`
   - Check linter: `read_lints` tool
   - Verify TypeScript compilation: `yarn rw type-check`
   - Review generated output files

4. **Code Review** (MINIMUM)
   - Read created files to verify content matches claims
   - Check imports/exports are correct
   - Verify no placeholder TODOs or incomplete code

### Examples

❌ **WRONG**:
- "Created ChatInterface component" → Marked complete
- No verification that it actually renders
- No verification that it connects to Ollama
- No verification that messages display

✅ **CORRECT**:
- Created ChatInterface component
- Verified build succeeds: `yarn rw build` ✅
- Checked for linter errors: No errors ✅
- Read rendered component to verify GraphQL queries present ✅
- Status: Verified complete

### For Plan Execution

When executing plans:
- Each phase marked ✅ must have verification evidence
- Document verification method used
- If verification fails, mark as ⚠️ with issue description
- Never skip verification to save time

### Verification Commands Reference

```bash
# Build verification
yarn rw build

# Type checking
yarn rw type-check

# Run tests
yarn rw test --no-watch

# Start app (manual testing)
yarn rw dev

# Check specific endpoint
curl http://localhost:8912
curl http://localhost:8911/graphql
```
