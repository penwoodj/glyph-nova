# Release Description Writing Rule

## Purpose

This rule defines how Cursor should write professional, clean GitHub release descriptions for Glyph Nova desktop app releases. Release descriptions should be human-readable, visually appealing with emojis, technically accurate, and include proper installation instructions.

## Release Description Structure

### Required Sections (in order)

1. **Title** - Version number with emoji prefix
2. **Summary** - Brief 2-3 sentence overview of the release
3. **What's New** - Feature additions and enhancements
4. **Improvements** - Bug fixes, performance improvements, refinements
5. **Technical Changes** - Behind-the-scenes technical updates (optional, only if significant)
6. **Installation Instructions** - Platform-specific installation guides
7. **Download Links** - Automatic (handled by GitHub Actions)

### Format Guidelines

#### Title Format
```
🚀 Release v0.1.0
```

#### Emoji Usage Guidelines
- Use emojis sparingly and consistently
- 🚀 for major releases
- ✨ for new features
- 🐛 for bug fixes
- 🔧 for improvements/refinements
- 📦 for installation/downloads
- ⚡ for performance improvements
- 🔒 for security updates
- 📝 for documentation updates

#### Language Style
- **Abstract and Human-Readable**: Write for end users, not just developers
- **Technical Jargon**: Use project-specific terms when they match visible UI elements (e.g., "Chat Interface", "File Tree", "Editor Panel")
- **Clarity**: Avoid overly technical implementation details unless relevant to users
- **Conciseness**: Keep descriptions focused and scannable

### Content Guidelines

  ```

#### Technical Changes (Optional)
- Only include if significant architectural changes

  - Optimized GraphQL API response streaming
  ```

#### Installation Instructions
- Must be comprehensive and cover all platforms
- Use 📦 emoji prefix
- Include platform-specific steps
- Reference installer types (`.dmg`, `.exe`, `.deb`, `.AppImage`, etc.)
- Example format:
  ```markdown

  **Windows:**
  1. Download the `.exe` installer for your architecture (x64 or ARM64)
  2. Run the installer and follow the setup wizard
  3. Launch Glyph Nova from the Start menu

  **Linux:**
  - **Debian/Ubuntu**: Download and install the `.deb` file
    ```bash
    sudo dpkg -i glyph-nova_*.deb
    ```
  - **Fedora/RHEL**: Download and install the `.rpm` file
    ```bash
    sudo rpm -i glyph-nova_*.rpm
    ```

    ```bash
    chmod +x glyph-nova_*.AppImage
    ./glyph-nova_*.AppImage
    ```
  ```

### Generating Release Descriptions

When generating a release description:

1. **Analyze Git Commits**: Review commits since last release to identify changes
2. **Categorize Changes**: Group into Features, Improvements, Bug Fixes
3. **User Impact Focus**: Emphasize user-visible changes over internal refactoring
4. **UI Element Names**: Use exact names from the UI (File Tree, Chat Interface, Editor Panel, etc.)
5. **Version Number**: Extract from `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` or `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`
6. **Build Artifacts**: Reference the actual build outputs (`.dmg`, `.exe`, `.deb`, `.rpm`, `.AppImage`)

### Quality Checklist

Before finalizing a release description, ensure:

- [ ] Title includes version number with emoji
- [ ] Summary is clear and concise (2-3 sentences)
- [ ] Features are user-focused and reference visible UI elements
- [ ] Installation instructions cover all platforms (macOS, Windows, Linux)
- [ ] Installer types are correctly referenced (`.dmg`, `.exe`, `.deb`, `.rpm`, `.AppImage`)
- [ ] Emojis are used consistently and appropriately
- [ ] Language is accessible to end users (not overly technical)
- [ ] Technical jargon matches project terminology (UI element names)
- [ ] All major changes since last release are included
- [ ] Formatting is clean and scannable with proper markdown

### Version Number Extraction

When generating releases, extract version from:
- Primary: `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` → `version` field
- Secondary: `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` → `version` field in `[package]` section

Both should be kept in sync, but `tauri.conf.json` is the source of truth for the desktop app version.
