# Link Context Gathering Rule

**Automated system for gathering, verifying, and formatting web links with context for research and documentation tasks.**

## 🎯 Purpose

This rule automates the process of:
1. **Finding verified working web links** for research topics
2. **Categorizing links by type** (blogs, forums, documentation, etc.)
3. **Formatting links in copyable blocks** for easy sharing
4. **Providing context and ratings** for each link
5. **Ensuring link quality** through verification
6. **Optimizing format for Cursor "Add Doc" indexing workflow**

## 📋 Trigger Conditions

**Apply this rule when user requests:**
- "Find me X different verified working web links to resources on Y"
- "Make X links to Y with specific criteria"
- "Suggest resources for Z topic"
- "Find high-quality links for research on Y"
- Any request involving web link gathering and verification

## 🔄 Automated Process

### Step 1: Link Discovery & Categorization
**Automatically identify and categorize links by type:**

```markdown
## [Topic] Resources

### Recipe Blogs with High Organic Ratings
- [Link 1] - [Brief description of quality/rating]
- [Link 2] - [Brief description of quality/rating]

### Forums & Community Resources
- [Link 1] - [Brief description of community activity]
- [Link 2] - [Brief description of community activity]

### Documentation & Guides
- [Link 1] - [Brief description of documentation quality]
- [Link 2] - [Brief description of documentation quality]
```

### Step 2: Link Verification & Formatting
**Format all links in copyable blocks with title included:**

```
https://example.com/resource-1
Title: Resource Name
```
**Description:** Brief explanation of why this link is valuable
**Rating:** High/Medium/Low based on organic search ranking and quality

```
https://example.com/resource-2
Title: Another Resource Name
```
**Description:** Brief explanation of why this link is valuable
**Rating:** High/Medium/Low based on organic search ranking and quality

**Note:** The title is included in the copyable block after the link to enable efficient pasting into Cursor's "Add Doc" feature - paste the block, extract the link for the first input, then extract the title for the second input.

### Step 3: Context Integration
**Provide comprehensive context for each link type:**

```markdown
## Link Categories Explained

**Recipe Blogs with High Organic Ratings:**
- Established food/cooking blogs with proven track records
- High search engine rankings and user engagement
- Tested recipes with detailed instructions

**Forums & Community Resources:**
- Active discussion communities with real user experiences
- Multiple perspectives and troubleshooting tips
- Various approaches and techniques discussed

**Documentation & Guides:**
- Official or well-maintained documentation
- Step-by-step instructions and best practices
- Comprehensive coverage of the topic
```

## 🎨 Copyable Format Standards

**Always format links in copyable blocks with title included after the link:**

```markdown
**1. [Resource Name]**
```
https://example.com/resource   Resource Name
```
**Description:** [Why this resource is valuable]
**Rating:** [High/Medium/Low] based on [criteria]
```

**Benefits:**
- Easy copy/paste for users
- Title included in copyable block for Cursor "Add Doc" workflow
- Paste block → extract link for first input → extract title for second input
- Clear categorization by resource type
- Quality indicators for decision-making
- Consistent formatting across all responses

**Cursor "Add Doc" Workflow Optimization:**
- Format enables efficient indexing: paste the copyable block, extract the URL for the first input field, then extract the title (after "Title: ") for the second modal input field
- This eliminates the need to manually type titles and speeds up the indexing process significantly

## 🔍 Quality Verification Process

### Link Quality Criteria:
1. **Organic Search Ranking** - Higher ranked = better quality
2. **Content Freshness** - Recent updates preferred
3. **User Engagement** - Comments, reviews, social shares
4. **Authority** - Established domains and authors
5. **Completeness** - Comprehensive coverage of topic

### Verification Steps:
1. **Check domain authority** and search rankings
2. **Verify content quality** and relevance
3. **Assess user engagement** metrics
4. **Confirm link accessibility** and working status
5. **Rate overall quality** based on criteria

## 📊 Response Structure

**Standard response format:**

```markdown
Based on the web search results, I can provide you with verified working links to [topic] resources. Here are [X] different types of resources:

## [Category 1] with High Organic Ratings

**1. [Resource Name]**
```
https://example.com/resource-1
Title: Resource Name
```
**Description:** [Why this resource is valuable]
**Rating:** High - [specific quality indicators]

**2. [Resource Name]**
```
https://example.com/resource-2
Title: Another Resource Name
```
**Description:** [Why this resource is valuable]
**Rating:** High - [specific quality indicators]

## [Category 2] Resources

**3. [Resource Name]**
```
https://example.com/resource-3
Title: Third Resource Name
```
**Description:** [Why this resource is valuable]
**Rating:** Medium - [specific quality indicators]

These resources provide a good mix of:
- **Traditional sources** with tested content and high ratings
- **Community-driven content** with multiple perspectives
