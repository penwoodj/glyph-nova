## User Prompts (In Order)

### Prompt 1: Initial JSON Creation Request
```
I'm going to create a folder structure of The types of workflows and known examples with dot git keep files that are going to Just be placeholders? and the folder structure And... how things connect, is going to represent the way that Kind of all of the features. Connect with the workflows. One example of this is that you could have A basic summarization workflow. Period. we could Make it so... You tell... An LLM? to repeatedly summarize with less detail. by creating line restrictments. Or maximums. With Really great citations. Those citations Are navigable by Another workflow. that uses The multi-level citation Summary. Workflow. So this could be implemented in cursor. as well. to create tests and documentation. that can be used as context for the feature implementation. of the workflow itself, In n8n. This is going to be very important because the initial implementation is going to use N8n workflows.

Actually, I think just creating a JSON file with the structure and how it all relates is probably better and easier for you to digest later.

I want you to attempt to create this json file based on the connections and relationships found throughout this folder /home/jon/code/glyph-nova/cursor/docs/reports/future-features about how workflows and workflow types connect to features, and keep the json file here /home/jon/code/glyph-nova/cursor/docs/reports/future-feature-to-workflow-mapping.json high level to start with the connections shown between features and workflow types, then expand and go into detail about high level behavior in the json format with strings and numbers , booleans and id strings and objects and arrays to map behavior in the json format, but after I want you to fill out detail of how thing might work in terms of sequential prompts and behavior of those prompts in light detail but for each workflow, so expected input and output behavior sequence in file creation and tool usage and in what order or with what loops on what conditions from a high level.

After make a new transcript file documenting what you created in the json file and how @cursor-extension/cursor/rules/manual/tracking/transcript-formatting-agent.mdc
```

### Prompt 2: Scope Generation and Navigation Workflows
```
Add to the structure the idea that multiLevelCitationSummary takes in a Scope prompt generated by scope generation workflow in the context of scoping out work for a chat message, but is also be used to take a general goal pompt, that the scope generation workflow generates itself and so forth.  So these workflows use each other to generate prompts for each other, and there is a workflows that uses these kinds of workflows to navigate.  So there are navigation workflows that look at verying levels of abstraction multiLevelCitationSummary results  to generate prompts or results,
```

### Prompt 3: Tool Workflows, Goal-Based Behavior, and Complete System
```
We also have tool using workflows that map from goal to behavior workflows.  I want the idea of

1a. We have tool workflows than can be used to create documents from pulling from different sources like running something in either a new or existing terminal and output terminal text into a log file; browser running and output elements css, console and network logs; or  using a search tool then putting results in a file, that can be summarized later.  So tool workflows generate files through running clis, terminal commands, or applications it can connect to in some way to generate log files of results in high levels of detail.

1b.  multiLevelCitationSummary workflows through creating various levels of interconnected abstract descriptions across custom formatted markdown files and links, through goal based behavior workflows that use tool workflows

2a. creating context navigation workflows that navigate those levels of abstraction, or any file abstraction heirarchy in folders, to create context specific information gathering summaries with the right level of abstraction of description in the output resonse of the context hierachy for a specific goal or aim or scope.  So we can have an extreme level of detail and these navigation workflows sort of act like a quality natural language compression algorithm that gets what it needs for the given task by navigating files with an understanding of ther interrelatedeness

2b. Context navigation workflows sort of navigate the landscape of possiblity in a context base and narrow the possiblities to those that are relevant to an aim, sort of like search targeted building through intelligent chunking across folders, sub-folder, files, interfile.

3. Then there are refactoring algorithms that improve quality without length change in a permanant file editing way for self improvment workflows. then there are compression workflows that remove detail to as much as needed based on metrics workflows that measure through abstract reasoning the result of a file when it comes to serving specific purposes. Compression workflows basically act like little cleaners that remove irrelevant or unneeded context in the form of markdown files through removing multiLevelCitationSummary results so they are still accurateMetricWorkflow results through a relevance metric workflow result etc

4. Goal Workflows create Conditional Behavior workflows to create a series of researchable questions the answers of which will create and dictate execution workflows functionality that use navigation workfows and tool workflows to

5. these workflows and agentic behaviors loop in various interconnected way through feature trigger types, and types of infinite bot workflows like: cron base, go until goal based on metrics is reach, never stop with great versioning, never stop with shadow files that can replace real files on approval etc

6. The 2 categories of workflow file expression are .md and n8n like config files, but they operate on themselves and log files to edit and generate all 3 types of files well, through natural language chat conversations
```

### Prompt 4: Context Navigation, Self-Improvement Loop, and Autonomous Behavior
```
1. Get enough context for task

2a. navigate context to answer questions in conditional behavior workflows

2b. as naviation starts also start context self improvment workflow loop, with various triggers, of expanding, improveing, then narrow the context base for goals workflows that operate at different scales of time in terms of metric workflow relevance ranking.  This loop is triggered by a relatedness matric workflow when a relevant idea shows up in a future prompt, related document.

2c. navigation workf

3. Scope workflows generate prompts that narrow the scope at various elvels of abstraction, meaning it's used to create summaries which is a kind of compression from everything to something specific about the document or the goal itself, and is used to na

4a. so we have a process where we get information using tools, clean that information for context navigability, the navigate that context base to create targeted smart context gathering queries to give just enough context for the level of specificity in a goal

4b.  we use a loop of prompt generation (pre, post, or without user prompt) and feeding back to llms, file creation and linking, tool calls that result in gathered context files,  that result in autonomous intelligent behavior that serves to complete goals of various level of describe abstraction.  This is the high level strucute of all feature level workflows use, and integrate with.
```

## Scoped Summary: What This Is Really About

### Core Vision
The user is designing a **self-referential, self-improving, autonomous workflow system** where workflows generate prompts for each other, operate on themselves, create context for their own implementation, and continuously improve through intelligent context management. This is fundamentally about creating a **meta-workflow system** that operates as an autonomous intelligent agent with:

1. **Context-First Architecture** - Get enough context for task, then navigate that context to answer questions and complete goals
2. **Self-Improving Context Loop** - Context self-improvement workflow continuously expands, improves, then narrows the context base for goal workflows operating at different time scales, triggered by relatedness metrics when relevant ideas appear
3. **Intelligent Compression Through Scope** - Scope workflows generate prompts that narrow scope at various abstraction levels, creating summaries as compression from "everything" to "something specific" about documents or goals
4. **Information Processing Pipeline** - Get information using tools → clean for context navigability → navigate context base → create targeted smart context gathering queries → give just enough context for goal specificity level
5. **Autonomous Behavior Loop** - Loop of prompt generation (pre/post/without user prompt) → LLM feedback → file creation and linking → tool calls → gathered context files → autonomous intelligent behavior serving goals at various abstraction levels
6. **Question-Answering Through Navigation** - Context navigation answers questions in conditional behavior workflows, enabling research-driven goal completion
7. **Time-Scale Aware Context Management** - Context self-improvement operates at different time scales using metric workflow relevance ranking for goal workflows
8. **The High-Level Structure** - This autonomous loop pattern is the high-level structure that all feature-level workflows use and integrate with

### Key Patterns Currently Reflected in JSON

**✅ Recursive Prompt Generation:**
- `scopeGeneration` can call itself recursively to generate sub-scopes
- `multiLevelCitationSummary` accepts scope prompts from `scopeGeneration`
- `navigation` uses `multiLevelCitationSummary` at different abstraction levels and generates scope prompts
- These workflows form recursive loops where they generate prompts for each other

**✅ Tool-to-Summary Pipeline:**
- `toolWorkflow` generates high-detail log files from terminals, browsers, search tools
- `goalBasedBehavior` uses tool workflows to create `multiLevelCitationSummary` results
- Creates interconnected markdown files with links across abstraction levels

**✅ Context Navigation as Compression:**
- `contextNavigation` navigates file hierarchies and abstraction levels
- Acts like a quality natural language compression algorithm
- Finds relevant content at the right abstraction level for goals/scopes
- Intelligent chunking across folders, sub-folders, files, and inter-file relationships

**✅ Self-Improvement Loop:**
- `refactoringAlgorithm` improves quality without length change
- `compressionWorkflow` removes irrelevant detail based on `metricWorkflow` results
- `metricWorkflow` measures how well files serve purposes through abstract reasoning
- These form a cyclic improvement loop

**✅ Goal-to-Execution Chain:**
- `goalWorkflow` creates `conditionalBehavior` workflows
- Generates researchable questions
- Answers create `executionWorkflow` specifications
- Execution workflows use `contextNavigation` and `toolWorkflow`

**✅ Feature Trigger Types:**
- Cron-based, goal-based (until metrics reached), never-stop (with versioning or shadow files)
- Workflows loop in interconnected ways through these triggers

**✅ Self-Referential File Operation:**
- Workflow .md files and n8n config files can operate on themselves
- All three file types (workflow .md, n8n config, logs) can be edited/generated through natural language chat
- Workflows can edit and generate workflow files

**✅ Context Navigation for Question Answering:**
- `contextNavigation` answers questions in conditional behavior workflows
- Navigates context base to find answers at appropriate abstraction levels
- Enables research-driven goal completion

**✅ Context Self-Improvement Loop:**
- `contextSelfImprovement` workflow loop: expand → improve → narrow
- Triggered by `relatednessMetric` when relevant ideas show up in future prompts or related documents
- Operates at different time scales using `metricWorkflow` relevance ranking
- Starts when navigation begins, continuously improving context base for goal workflows

**✅ Scope as Compression:**
- `scopeGeneration` narrows scope at various abstraction levels
- Creates summaries as compression from "everything" to "something specific" about document or goal
- Used to create targeted context by compressing broad context into focused scope

**✅ Information Processing Pipeline:**
- Get information using tools → clean for context navigability → navigate context base → create targeted smart context gathering queries → give just enough context for goal specificity level
- This pipeline ensures context is always at the right level of detail for the task

**✅ Autonomous Behavior Loop:**
- Prompt generation (pre/post/without user prompt) → LLM feedback → file creation and linking → tool calls → gathered context files → autonomous intelligent behavior
- Serves goals at various levels of described abstraction
- This is the high-level structure all feature-level workflows use and integrate with

### What's Missing or Could Be Enhanced

The JSON currently captures the structure and relationships, but could better emphasize:

1. **The autonomous loop as foundational pattern** - How the prompt → LLM → files → tools → context → behavior loop is the high-level structure
2. **Context self-improvement as continuous process** - How context expands, improves, and narrows continuously, triggered by relatedness
3. **Time-scale awareness** - How different goal workflows operate at different time scales with appropriate context narrowing
4. **Question-answering as navigation** - How context navigation answers questions in conditional behavior workflows
5. **Scope as intelligent compression** - How scope workflows compress from everything to something specific
6. **The information processing pipeline** - How tools → cleaning → navigation → targeted queries → just-enough-context works

## Suggested Prompts for JSON Enhancement

### Suggested Prompt 1: Autonomous Behavior Loop as High-Level Structure
```
I want the JSON to clearly document the autonomous behavior loop as the foundational high-level structure that all feature-level workflows use and integrate with. Specifically:

1. Document the complete loop: prompt generation (pre/post/without user prompt) → LLM feedback → file creation and linking → tool calls → gathered context files → autonomous intelligent behavior
2. Show how this loop serves goals at various levels of described abstraction
3. Emphasize that this is THE high-level structure all feature workflows integrate with
4. Document how different workflow types participate in different parts of this loop
5. Show how the loop creates autonomous intelligent behavior that completes goals

Add a new top-level section "autonomousBehaviorLoop" that documents:
- The complete loop structure with all phases
- How each phase connects to specific workflow types
- How goals at different abstraction levels are served
- How this creates the foundation for all feature-level workflows
- Examples of how different workflows participate in the loop
```

### Suggested Prompt 2: Context Self-Improvement Loop with Time-Scale Awareness
```
I want the JSON to better document the context self-improvement loop and its time-scale awareness. Specifically:

1. Document the expand → improve → narrow loop that operates continuously
2. Show how it's triggered by relatedness metric workflow when relevant ideas show up in future prompts or related documents
3. Emphasize how it starts when navigation begins
4. Document how it operates at different time scales using metric workflow relevance ranking
5. Show how it narrows context base for goal workflows operating at different time scales
6. Document the relationship between time scales and context narrowing strategies

Add detailed documentation showing:
- The three-phase loop (expand, improve, narrow) with detailed behavior sequences
- How relatedness metric triggers the loop
- How time scales (short/medium/long term) affect context narrowing
- How metric workflow relevance ranking guides narrowing
- How this creates context bases optimized for different goal workflow time scales
- Examples of context bases for different time-scale goals
```

### Suggested Prompt 3: Information Processing Pipeline and Question-Answering Navigation
```
I want the JSON to clearly document the information processing pipeline and how context navigation answers questions. Specifically:

1. Document the complete pipeline: get information using tools → clean for context navigability → navigate context base → create targeted smart context gathering queries → give just enough context for goal specificity level
2. Show how context navigation answers questions in conditional behavior workflows
3. Emphasize how navigation finds answers at appropriate abstraction levels
4. Document how this enables research-driven goal completion
5. Show how scope workflows compress from "everything" to "something specific" to create targeted context
6. Document how the pipeline ensures "just enough context" for the level of specificity in a goal

Add a new section "informationProcessingPipeline" that documents:
- Each step of the pipeline with workflow connections
- How tools generate information that gets cleaned
- How cleaning enables context navigability
- How navigation creates targeted queries
- How queries gather just-enough context for goal specificity
- How context navigation answers questions from conditional behavior workflows
- How scope workflows compress context for targeting
- Examples of the pipeline in action for different goal types
```

## Session Overview

### Initial Context

The user requested creation of a JSON file mapping workflow types to features based on connections found in the `/home/jon/code/glyph-nova/cursor/docs/reports/future-features` directory. The goal was to:

1. Start with high-level connections between features and workflow types
2. Expand with detailed behavior information (strings, numbers, booleans, objects, arrays)
3. Add sequential prompt behavior for each workflow
4. Document expected input/output, file creation, tool usage, order, loops, and conditions
5. Create a transcript documenting the creation

**User's Specific Example:**
- Basic summarization workflow that repeatedly summarizes with less detail using line restrictions
- Great citations that are navigable
- Citations navigable by multi-level citation summary workflow
- Could be implemented in Cursor to create tests and documentation
- Documentation can be used as context for feature implementation of workflows in n8n

**Target File:**
- `/home/jon/code/glyph-nova/cursor/docs/reports/future-feature-to-workflow-mapping.json`

### Phase 1: Documentation Analysis

**Actions Taken:**
1. Listed and read all files in future-features directory (15 files)
2. Analyzed key documents:
   - `workflows.md` - Core workflow system documentation
   - `agentic-mode-system.md` - Mode structure and selection
   - `context-engineering.md` - Context gathering and chunking
   - `self-improvement-system.md` - Learning and improvement mechanisms
   - `multi-source-integration.md` - MCP and RAG integration
   - `smart-chunking-memory.md` - Memory and pattern learning
   - `transparency-observability.md` - Logging and visibility
   - `technical-architecture.md` - System architecture
   - `implementation-roadmap.md` - Development phases
   - And 6 more supporting documents

**Key Findings:**
- Two workflow file types: Markdown workflow documents and n8n-like config files
- Workflows can inherit and combine
- Self-improvement uses scoped summary workflows
- Context gathering is central to all workflows
- Summarization workflows can create context for their own implementation

### Phase 2: JSON Structure Design

**Design Decisions:**
1. **Metadata Section** - Version, description, purpose
2. **Workflow Types** - Each workflow type as a separate object with:
   - Basic info (id, name, description)
   - Feature connections
   - High-level behavior (input/output types, behavior flags)
   - Detailed behavior sequence (steps with prompts, tools, loops, conditions)
   - Integration points (uses/used-by relationships)
   - n8n implementation notes
3. **Feature to Workflow Mapping** - How features connect to workflows
4. **Workflow Composition** - Common patterns and composition strategies
5. **Implementation Guidance** - n8n workflow creation process and Cursor integration

**Workflow Types Identified:**
1. **basicSummarization** - Iterative summarization with citations
2. **multiLevelCitationSummary** - Hierarchical, navigable summaries
3. **documentationGeneration** - Creates docs, tests, examples
4. **contextGathering** - Multi-source context gathering
5. **modeSelection** - Automatic mode detection
6. **selfImprovement** - Log analysis and workflow improvement
7. **codeReview** - Code analysis and review
8. **research** - RAG and web search research

### Phase 3: Detailed Behavior Sequences

**For Each Workflow, Documented:**

1. **High-Level Behavior:**
   - Input types and requirements
   - Output types and structure
   - Behavior flags (iterative, hierarchical, etc.)

2. **Behavior Sequence Steps:**
   - Step number and name
   - Prompt description
   - Input structure
   - Output structure
   - Tools used
   - Conditions (if/then/else logic)
   - Loops (iteration conditions and actions)
   - File creation (when applicable)

3. **Integration Points:**
   - Which workflows use this workflow
   - Which workflows this workflow uses
   - n8n node types needed

**Example: Basic Summarization Workflow**

**5 Steps Documented:**
1. Initial Content Analysis - Analyzes structure and determines strategy
2. First Pass Summarization - Creates initial summary with citations
3. Iterative Detail Reduction - Reduces detail while maintaining citations (with loop)
4. Citation Validation - Verifies citation accuracy and creates navigation links
5. Output Generation - Formats and writes output files

**Key Features:**
- Loop condition: `lineCount > maxLines` with max 5 iterations
- File creation: summary.md, citations.json, metadata.json
- Error handling: retry with reduced scope, fallback to basic summary

### Phase 4: Feature Mapping

**Feature-to-Workflow Relationships Documented:**

- **context-engineering** → Uses: contextGathering, basicSummarization, smartChunking
- **agentic-mode-system** → Uses: modeSelection, workflowComposition
- **self-improvement-system** → Uses: selfImprovement, patternLearning
- **workflows** → Uses: basicSummarization, multiLevelCitationSummary, documentationGeneration
- **multi-source-integration** → Uses: contextGathering, research
- **smart-chunking-memory** → Uses: contextGathering, patternLearning
- **transparency-observability** → Uses: logging, promptVisibility

**Workflow Composition Patterns:**
1. **summarization-chain** - Basic → Multi-level (sequential)
2. **documentation-pipeline** - Basic → Multi-level → Documentation (sequential)
3. **context-aware-execution** - Context gathering → Any workflow (parallel-then-sequential)
4. **self-improvement-loop** - Logging → Self-improvement → Workflow update (cyclic)

### Phase 5: Implementation Guidance

**n8n Workflow Creation Process:**
1. Start with markdown workflow definition
2. Use documentation generation workflow to create tests and context
3. Use generated documentation as context for n8n implementation
4. Implement n8n nodes based on behavior sequence
5. Connect nodes according to step order and conditions
6. Add error handling and fallback mechanisms
7. Test with sample inputs

**Cursor Integration Use Case:**
- Use basic summarization to summarize feature requirements
- Use multi-level citation summary for navigable documentation
- Use documentation generation for comprehensive docs and tests
- Use generated artifacts as context for n8n workflow implementation
- Iterate based on n8n implementation feedback

### Phase 6: File Creation

**File Created:**
- `/home/jon/code/glyph-nova/cursor/docs/reports/future-feature-to-workflow-mapping.json`

**File Statistics:**
- Size: ~45KB
- Structure: Well-organized JSON with clear sections
- Completeness: All 8 workflow types fully documented
- Relationships: Feature mappings and composition patterns included

**Verification:**

## Technical Details

### JSON Structure

```json
{
  "metadata": { ... },
  "workflowTypes": {
    "basicSummarization": {
      "id": "basic-summarization",
      "name": "Basic Summarization Workflow",
      "description": "...",
      "featureConnections": [...],
      "workflowFormat": "markdown",
      "canBePreprocessed": true,
      "highLevelBehavior": { ... },
      "behaviorSequence": {
        "steps": [ ... ]
      },
      "integrationPoints": { ... }
    },
    // ... 7 more workflow types
  },
  "featureToWorkflowMapping": { ... },
  "workflowComposition": { ... },
  "implementationGuidance": { ... }
}
```

### Key Workflow Behavior Patterns

**Sequential Execution:**
- Steps execute one after another
- Output of one step becomes input of next
- Example: Basic Summarization → Multi-Level Citation Summary

**Parallel Execution:**
- Multiple steps execute simultaneously
- Example: Context gathering from files, MCP, RAG in parallel

**Conditional Execution:**
- Steps execute based on conditions
- Example: Web search only if RAG results insufficient

**Loop Execution:**
- Steps repeat based on conditions
- Example: Iterative detail reduction until line count target met

**Nested Workflow Invocation:**
- Workflows call other workflows
- Example: Documentation Generation calls Basic Summarization

### File Creation Patterns

Each workflow documents file creation patterns:
- **Output paths** - Where files are created
- **Content structure** - What goes in each file
- **Format** - Markdown, JSON, code, etc.
- **Backup** - Whether backups are created

### Error Handling Patterns

Each workflow includes:
- **onFailure** action
- **maxRetries** limit
- **fallback** strategy

## Key Insights

### Insight 1: Workflow Interdependence
Workflows are highly interdependent. Basic Summarization feeds into Multi-Level Citation Summary, which feeds into Documentation Generation. This creates a natural pipeline for creating implementation context.

### Insight 2: Self-Referential Implementation
The Documentation Generation workflow can create tests and documentation that serve as context for implementing the workflows themselves in n8n. This creates a self-improving cycle.

### Insight 3: Context as Foundation
Context Gathering is central to all workflows. Every workflow either uses context gathering directly or benefits from well-gathered context.

### Insight 4: Iterative Refinement
Many workflows use iterative loops (e.g., detail reduction, pattern matching) with clear stopping conditions. This enables progressive refinement.

### Insight 5: Error Handling Strategy
All workflows include error handling with fallback strategies. This ensures robustness even when primary paths fail.

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. ✅ JSON file created and validated
2. ✅ Transcript created documenting the process
3. ⏳ User review and feedback

### Future Enhancements
1. Add more workflow types as they are identified
