## Executive Summary

Meta-workflow optimization involves measuring, analyzing, and improving workflows at a higher level than individual automation steps. By implementing workflow measurement, iteration reduction strategies, abstraction level optimization, feedback loop automation, and meta-learning, users can create self-improving workflows that become more efficient over time. This report examines meta-optimization strategies, measurement techniques, and patterns for creating continuously improving workflows.

**Key Recommendations:**
- Implement workflow measurement and metrics tracking
