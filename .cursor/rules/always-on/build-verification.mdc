# Build & Runtime Verification

## After Every Code Change: Verify Build

### Minimum Verification Steps

1. **Run Build Command**
   ```bash
   yarn rw build
   # OR for faster iteration
   yarn rw build web  # Frontend only
   yarn rw build api  # Backend only
   ```

2. **Check Exit Code**
   - Exit code 0 = Success ✅
   - Exit code 1+ = Failure ❌
   - Never claim success without checking exit code

3. **Read Build Output**
   - Look for "✔ Building Web..." or errors
   - Check for warnings that might indicate issues
   - Verify no compilation errors

### For New Features: Runtime Verification

When adding new features, verify in running app:

```bash
# Start dev server
yarn rw dev

# Wait 10-30 seconds for startup
# Then check logs for errors

# Access the app
# - Browser: http://localhost:8912
# - Terminal: curl http://localhost:8912
# - GraphQL: http://localhost:8911/graphql
```

**Check for:**
- Server starts without errors
- Routes respond correctly
- GraphQL queries/mutations work
- No console errors in browser/terminal

### Quick Verification Template

```markdown
**Verification:**
- Build: ✅ `yarn rw build` succeeded (14s)
- Linter: ✅ No errors
- Runtime: ✅ App starts, feature visible at http://localhost:8912
```

### Never Skip Verification

Even for "simple" changes:
- Imports could be wrong
- Types might not match
- Runtime errors might occur

**Always verify. Always.**
